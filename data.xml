    My name is Yoann, I go by “yo252yo“. I'm a transmedia author, meaning I do all kind of things at the junction of contemporary art, philosophy, academia, technology and pop culture.

    <history>
      <text>I'm focused on writing, in the most general sense that meaning and semantics are my clay. From text to transmedia experiences, I try to push the boundaries of the format I use and to make unique things that I want to see in the world but nobody else will make them.</text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <text>I tend to gravitate around themes like the mind and the self in the broadest sense, be them artificial or biological (from philosophy to psychology but also posthumanism, ux and game design) and their agency in the midst of complex systems.</text>

      <description>The game falls into the "Game and art" category, any review with less than 30 minutes of play will not render justice to it.</description>
