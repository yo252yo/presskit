    <history>
      <text>I'm a simple engineer who couldn't settle into an office job. Even when studying, I used to do creative writing on the side, but through the 2010s I moved towards more interactive projects. That's where videogames come in as an extremely potent medium of exploration.</text>

      <text>For now, I pursue these interests in my spare time, on the side of my job as Software Engineer for Google.</text>

      <description>The game falls into the "Game and art" category, any review with less than 30 minutes of play will not render justice to it.</description>
